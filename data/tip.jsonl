 "tip":"Rule-of-thirds is just one option. Centered or axial symmetry can work if you control edge weight and contrast away from the axis."}

{"id":"comp-dynamic-balance",

 "when":{"entropy>":18.0},ß
 "tip":"Attention feels diffuse. Try dynamic balance: a larger, softer mass countered by a smaller, high-contrast accent near the focal path."}

 "when":{"focal_local_contrast<":0.12},
 "tip":"Increase separation at the focal point—sharper edges or a 1–2 value step jump around the subject."}

 "when":{"sat_mean<":0.12},
 "tip":"Palette reads achromatic. If intentional, lean into edge quality and shape design; if not, introduce a small high-chroma accent."}
