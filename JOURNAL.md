## 2025-08-26 â€“ Week 2, Day 2
### Goal
Baseline CLIP retrieval working with small index

### What I did
- Embedded 10k WikiArt images with ViT-B/32
- Built FAISS index; added top_k API in src/models/clip_index.py

### Key learnings
- CLIP works well for stylistic similarity vs ResNet features
- Index build time acceptable; memory OK for 30k images

### Challenges
- Some returns are semantically right but style-off

### Next steps
- Add style classifier head for comparison
- Start P@5 human eval rubric
